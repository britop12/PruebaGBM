### **Input**

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer x (1≤x≤106) — the
destination point.

### Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum number of jumps to reach x. It can be proved that we can reach any integer point x.
